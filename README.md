## Overview
Here's a Sketch plugin to sync shared text and layer styles from a Sketch Library into the current document.

### How do I use it?
* Run `Sync with imported libraries` to sync with libraries in use (you already use symbols from)
or
* Run `Sync with...` to choose the library you want to sync with

### How does it match styles?
By name
* if the style doesn't exist, it's created
* if it does exist, it's overwritten

### Does sync work both ways?
No, sync is only one-way (from Library to document).
Any changes to your document's shared styles will get overwritten next time you run the plugin.

### Which Libraries does it sync from?
`Sync with imported libraries` syncs with all libraries you've inserted at least a symbol from.
`Sync with...` allows you to choose the library you want to sync from.

## JSON (experimental / WIP)
* add URLs for color and typography JSON files
* sync those JSON styles as text styles

Apologies for poor docs on this - it's still a work-in-progress
